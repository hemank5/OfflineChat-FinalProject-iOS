Final Project Description and Documentation: 
Application is based on Offline Chat system where iOS users can interact with
other iOS users who are nearby without using internet. 
Whenever any user is using the app this app would connect to other users which would would allow users to chat with each other. This app allows multiple users to connect each other if they are nearby to range of Wifi & Bluetooth. 
Currently the app is limited to basic chat only to a group.

App Features:
MultipeerConnectivity: This framework supports the discovery of services provided by nearby devices and supports communicating with those services through message-based data, streaming data, and resources (such as files). In iOS, the framework uses infrastructure Wi-Fi networks, peer-to-peer Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth personal area networks for the underlying transport. In macOS and tvOS, it uses infrastructure Wi-Fi, peer-to-peer Wi-Fi, and Ethernet.
